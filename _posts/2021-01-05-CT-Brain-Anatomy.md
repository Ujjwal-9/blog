CT scans use a series of X-ray beams passed through the head. The images are then developed on sensitive film. This method creates cross-sectional images of the brain and shows the structure of the brain, but not its function.

Brain imaging methods allow neuroscientists to see inside the living brain. These methods help neuroscientists:
- Understand the relationships between specific areas of the brain and what function they serve.
- Locate the areas of the brain that are affected by neurological disorders.
- Develop new strategies to treat brain disorders

# Introduction

Understanding brain anatomy is important to read CT scans. In this blog we will got through key anatomy which will make CT scans more apparent to you. For the first, CT scans are viewed from below, so right side of the brain is on left side of viewer. Front part of head (Anterior) is on top.

# Anatomy

## Skull

The brain is located inside an area bounded by skull and skull base called cranial vault. It is a protective casing for brain and brianstem. At the skull base the bones of the cranial vault form the cranial fossae which accommodate and support the brain.

Skull sutures has jagged appearance by nature they are not to be confused with fracture. In the figure, **dipole** is a porous bone tissue which seprates outer (thick and dense) and inner (thin, dense and brittle) tables. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvaria_(skull)#Layers)

**Sutures**: There are 4 main sutures:
1. Coronal (Connects *frontal bone with parietal bones*)
2. Sagittal (Connects *parietal bones in the midline*)
3. Lambdoid (Connects *parietal bones with the occipital bone*)
4. Squamosal (Connects *squamous portion of the temporal bone with the parietal bones*)
5. Metopic (Present in adults, Connects *2 fontal bones*)

> Thinnest part of skull is **PTERION**. The frontal, parietal, temporal and sphenoid bones unite at this point.


## Sinuses

The sinuses are hollow spaces in the skull and the face bones around your nose.

> The mastoid air cells are continuous with the middle ear.

> In case of traumna, fluid in the sphenoid sinus may be a sign of a basal skull fracture.

## Meninges

Knowledge about meninges is essential for understanding intracranial bleeding in CT scans.

### Tentorium cerebelli 

Tentorium is an extension of the dura; it separates the cerebrum (brain) from the cerebellum.

This is what Tentorial Subdural Hemorrhage look like on CT. It may resemble [intraparenchymal bleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraparenchymal_hemorrhage#:~:text=Intraparenchymal%20hemorrhage%20(IPH)%20is%20one,a%20wide%20spectrum%20of%20disorders.) on CT.

### Falx cerebri

It lies in midline and separates the left and right cerebral hemispheres.

A midline shift may occur when the pressure exerted by the buildup of blood and swelling around the damaged brain tissues is powerful enough to push the entire brain off-center.

## Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) spaces

The brain is surrounded by CSF fluids within the sulci, fissures and basal cisterns. 

> CSF has lower density than gray or white matter (discussed ahead), hence appear darker in CT scans. 

- Gyrus = a fold of the brain surface (plural = gyri)
- Sulcus = furrow between the gyri which contains CSF (plural = sulci)

### Fissures

These are components of brain which serperate the two halves of the brain.

> - Two **hemispheres** are seperated by **interhemispheric fissure**.
> - Two **lobes** - frontal and temporal lobes are seperated by **Sylvian**

### Ventricles

Spaces inside brain containing CSF.
