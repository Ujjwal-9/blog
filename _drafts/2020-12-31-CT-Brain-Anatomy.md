CT scans use a series of X-ray beams passed through the head. The images are then developed on sensitive film. This method creates cross-sectional images of the brain and shows the structure of the brain, but not its function.

Brain imaging methods allow neuroscientists to see inside the living brain. These methods help neuroscientists:
- Understand the relationships between specific areas of the brain and what function they serve.
- Locate the areas of the brain that are affected by neurological disorders.
- Develop new strategies to treat brain disorders
