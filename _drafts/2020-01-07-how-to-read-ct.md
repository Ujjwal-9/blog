# Introduction

Head CT is also called Brain CT. It refers to computed tomography examination of the brain and surrounding structures. It can be performed in 2 ways:
1. Non-Contrast Study
2. Contrast Study


**Preparation:**

- Without Contrast: No preparation is required.
- With Contrast:
    1. Only one CT contrast study should be scheduled within a 48 hour period.
    2. BUN & Creatinine must be done within 72 hours of the scan.
    3. Nothing but clear liquid after midnight before the scan.
    4. NPO 4 hours prior to exam (no food or drink).

During examination of CT scans, it is important to review old scans as they may provide information which is as clinically important as the current scans

**For example**:

> This elderly patient - who presented with acute confusion - has a large area of low density in the right frontal lobe seen on the current CT Review of a previous CT revealed that the abnormality in the brain was not new, but related to an infarct which occurred 5 months earlier The current CT appearances were not the cause of the acute confusion (urinary tract infection in this case)

# Approach

In emergency situations radiologists tend to follow this mnemonic: **Blood Can Be Very Bad** (BCBVB).

 B: blood

    look for epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and (also) extracranial hemorrhage 

 C: cisterns

    look for the presence of blood, effacement and asymmetry in four key cisterns (perimesencephalic, suprasellar, quadrigeminal and Sylvian cisterns)

 B: brain

    look for asymmetry or effacement of the sulcal pattern, gray-white matter differentiation (including the insular ribbon sign), structural shifts and abnormal hypodensities (e.g. air, edema, fat) or hyperdensities (e.g. blood, calcification)

 V: ventricles

    look for intraventricular hemorrhage, ventricular effacement or shift and for hydrocephalus 

B: bone
    
    look for skull fractures (especially basal) on bone windows (soft tissue swelling, mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses fluid in the setting of trauma should raise the possibility of a skull fracture; intracranial air means that the skull and the dura have been violated somewhere)

To look for these neuropathology, there is a 3 step process:

## Check Brain Parenchyma

### Midline Shift

Presence of space-occupying lesions may cause midline shift, which intrun will cause compression on the anterior cerebral artery and eventually infarct (area of dead tissue caused by a loss of blood supply; a localized necrosis).

Three midline structures should be examined when looking for midline shift:

1. Septum pellucidum: a membrane located between lateral ventricles
2. Third ventricle
3. Pineal gland

**Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)**

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is when blood suddenly bursts into brain tissue, causing damage to your brain.

Symptoms: headache, weakness, confusion, and paralysis, particularly on one side of your body

ICH encompasses many conditions characterized by the extravascular accumulation of blood within different intracranial spaces. Following categorization is based on locaiton:

- intra-axial hemorrhage
    - intracerebral hemorrhage
    - basal ganglia hemorrhage
    - lobar hemorrhage
    - pontine hemorrhage
    - cerebellar hemorrhage

- extra-axial hemorrhage
    - extradural hemorrhage (EDH)
    - intralaminar dural hemorrhage
    - subdural hemorrhage (SDH)
    - subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
    - intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)
    - subpial hemorrhage


Intracranial hemorrhage can be thought of in terms of the underlying cause:


- trauma
  - extradural hemorrhage (EDH)
  - subdural hemorrhage (SDH)
  - subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
  - cerebral hemorrhagic contusion

- vascular malformation(s)
  - berry aneurysm
  - mycotic aneurysm
  - arteriovenous malformation (AVM)
  - dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF)

- tumor related hemorrhage
- hypertension: hypertensive hemorrhage
- cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)
- cerebral venous thrombosis


**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**
